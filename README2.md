This repo guides you from blank Node JS project to project containing various JS module examples fully covered with [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) using all of its features. Unified harness-agnostic codebase allows running tests written once on three different test harnesses: [Mocha JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha), [TAP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap) and [Tape JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape). And to start using all these convenient test capabilities you'll need barely more than nothing: add one package to `devDependencies` and create `ddry.json` config file with handy CLI.

### Prerequisites ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

To get access to `ddry`, `ddry-mocha`, `ddry-tap` and `ddry-tape` shell commands install the core package [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) and its full `devDependencies` support [ddry-mocha-tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry-mocha-tape) by:

```sh
$ npm i -g ddry
$ npm i -g ddry-mocha-tape
```

You'll be able to run your data-driven specs against three JS testing harnesses. That probably may be useful to validate your preferences. However, if you already know, which harness you'll **never** use, there are single-harness packages [ddry-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry-mocha), [ddry-tap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry-tap) and [ddry-tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry-tape).

Also this project uses global installation of [CoffeeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coffee-script), so please provide it:

```sh
$ npm i -g coffee-script
```

### Getting started ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

Now you're set and ready to follow the easy steps distributed by commits of this repo quite gradually and mostly self-explaining.

```sh
$ npm init
$ npm i ddry-mocha-tape --save-dev
```

look very clear and familiar, so let's take our first stop for explaining at [Add Makefile](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/commit/61b7b07166ee771bf3eaf184062f6e225f2d5fb6), where we see:

- the basic project watcher on `make c-w` command (use `make c-` to just compile the source);
- test-related harness-specific tasks relying on local `devDependencies`;
- and, most important of all, using `./node_modules/ddry/ddry.js` as service endpoint.

Then we use an easy example module containing basic cases for which earliest [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) features were written for and our first mock data-driven spec file for [Initial population of `lib` and `spec` folders](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/commit/0da6ef5c4c65f0b9bb591976ddfadf4133fa5f12).

And start [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) magic of initializing the spec suite config file `ddry.json` by simply giving the specs folders path, target code folder path and the suite title to `ddry i` command:

```sh
$ ddry i spec/ lib/ 'ddry guide test suite'
```

Resulting config file can suddenly be seen [here](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/commit/47e30020fae390209076e2dfaf1f37e1de1cd061).

Among obvious things we can see here the recognizable by `ddry titles` or `ddry t` command module title format, i.e. first block comment:

CoffeeScript:
```coffee
###
# Numbering module example
###
```

or JavaScript:
```js
/*
 * Numbering module example
 */
```

Just to say it clearly: at this point we can run our minimum viable spec suite by `make` tasks `mocha`, `tap` and `tape` against corresponding test harness and with `test` against all of them. Shell commands `ddry-mocha`, `ddry-tap` and `ddry-tape` without parameters will produce the same results.

And that is where we smoothly come from getting started to main features.

### Convention over configuration spec folder structure ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

Now we have `ddry.json` stating that `spec` is our spec folder and `lib` is our code folder. At the moment the only code module in `lib` is `numbering`, so `spec/numbering` is the folder for this module method specs. We even have `spec/numbering/ordinal.js` file containg the spec of `ordinal` method of this module. Sounds trivially, same as any good convention over configuration. I've heard somewhere that triviality is a backside of wisdom.

However, let's mention some features of [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) behavior regarding misplaced spec folder files or folders.

Spec folder of non-existent module will simply be ignored.

Non-existent spec folder for existing module (named e.g. `exists`) will result in pending spec stating

```
Module 'exists' folder missing
  - Directory 'node_modules/spec/exists' does not exist.
```

Mentioning of `node_modules` in error message reveals failing paths lookup order.

Empty module spec folders will also be mentioned this way.

Inside the folder of existing module file for method that is not defined (named e.g. `method`) will result in pending spec stating

```
Method method()
  - is not defined in 'Numbering module example'
```

Notices on missing method specs are not provided.

### Injected ddry instance ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

At last, we are in correctly placed spec file of method defined in existent module. First of all, it is a JS module exporting function where first argument is an injected instance of [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) core module `index.js`.

Through [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) codebase it is reffered as `dd` standing for data-driven. It contains some methods we can use for data-driven testing and some data about the whole modular spec suite. At this point methods are much more important than anything else.

And most important of them is definitely `drive` that takes assertion object or array of assertion objects and delivers it to every test harness [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) knows about in processable form to produce an actual assertion.

Before we dig too deep into it, let's mention `pending` method taking no arguments and simply producing **pending** assertion outputting module title and method it is invoked for. To make a good spec stub clearly reporting its location, create a file this way:

```coffee
'use strict'

module.exports = (dd) ->
  dd.drive [
    dd.pending()
  ]
```

At this point, being saved as `source/spec/numbering/range.coffee`, compiled to `spec/numbering/range.js` it will produce

```
range()
  - pending: Numbering module example: range()
```

That output may be handy if you have several spec stubs.

### Plain matcher ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

At this point our mock spec of `ordinal` method is defined this way:

```coffee
'use strict'

module.exports = (dd) ->
  dd.drive [
    matcher: 'plain'
    it: 'really makes a test!'
    i: undefined
    e: undefined
  ]
```

What is a little bit more than self-explaining, it is just cross-harness assertion that `i` (standing for `input`) is deep equal `e` (standing for `expected`) â€” let's expand these abbreviations one more last time.

However, some features of `plain` matcher are worth mentioning:
- it is the only matcher independent from spec folder convention-over-configuration context;
- it is the only matcher taking `i` without wrapping into array;
- it is the matcher used in `dd.pending` method for [TAP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap), unlike the other two harnesses, requires even pending assertion to be defined.

Main purpose of `plain` matcher is supporting the crucial concept that every spec is a normal JS program. Test whatever you get in your usual JS flow, even within [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) convention-over-configuration context.

### Default matcher ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

In [Getting real. Introducing sequences](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/commit/4d809fa31ab69c8c60c29f029c2cf3c1ee63102e) first of all we move from `plain` matcher to `default` one.

It takes `i`, **mandatorily wrapped into array**, applies to current module's current method and asserts that exactly `e` is returned _(Looks like we're back again to convention-over-configuration trivialities)_. It is that much completely clear, that I even see no point to describe **mandatory array wrapping of input** concept any more.

### Sequences ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

_This is definitely ridiculous (or peculiar at least) that whole this [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) project containing by now over 2.5k of fully test covered lines of code started from refactoring of `ordinal` method spec._

To prevent any confusion, let's explain the **sequence** word usage a little deeper.

**Specs sequence** is an array of assertion objects received by `dd.drive` method. 

**Sequence spec** is a special assertion object containing mandatory `it` and `data` properties and optional one `from`.

### Sequence specs ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

This way, here

```coffee
'use strict'

module.exports = (dd, that) ->
  dd.drive [
    it: (i, e) -> "returns #{e} for #{i}"
    data: [ '1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th' ]
  ,
    it: (i, e) -> "returns #{e} for #{i}"
    from: 11
    data: [ '11th', '12th', '13th' ]
  ,
    it: (i, e) -> "returns #{e} for #{i}"
    from: 21
    data: [ '21st', '22nd', '23rd' ]
  ]
```

we see the _sequence specs sequence_.

To follow this code fragment's **sequence spec** self-explanation, let's state that:
- `it` is a function of `i` and `e` returning assertion message:
- inputs sent to tested method are consecutive indexes starting from 1 or specified `from`;
- range length is defined by expected values array.

I'm aware of generated assertion messages dangers, and thought many times about removing this feature completely. However, in rare cases **sequence specs** may suddenly become handy. Later we'll explore deeper features of **sequence specs**, but now please note that here only really boring input gets omitted, output is set literally. That slightly mitigates assertion message generation risks.

### Specs sequences. Cross-harness x-style skipping and mass-skipping ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

Let's use this **specs sequence** to learn about `x`-style skipping. It's easy: `xit` will get the assertion skipped on every test harness. You don't have to care how exactly the assertion is to be marked as pending on every certain test harness (take my word for it, it's very different between them), just `x` it. It's time to reveal that **Mocha** style is followed here fully, and `dd.drive` function recognizes also `specify` and `xspecify` keys.

Mass-skipping is much more funny. In **specs sequence** we can set additional options for all the following assertion objects.

If `dd.drive` meets the spec object not containing `it`, `i`, `e` or `it`, `data` key sets, it considers it as shared spec settings object and applies its keys to every valid spec object until the other shared spec settings object is met or **specs sequence** ends. That's how we can set the matcher for all the **specs sequence** once or mass-skip some of them.

Plainly, insert `xit: 0` shared spec settings object to start mass-skipping.

Insert empty object to clear shared spec settings.

Another cool feature of `xit` mass-skipping is that string value of this key will be considered as custom pending message. Or set value of any other type to get default pending message.

To summarize sequences topic, take a look at another sequence spec data format [here](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/blob/e0cf1952026d0a4df5ad8d1a2b69a3df6709df8c/source/spec/numbering/selector.coffee). Please consider this as an answer why `it` key can not be the shared specs setting although **sequence spec** message generators are similar, sometimes identical through **spec sequence**. This would definitely be a major design error.

Also, from this point we'll stop emphasizing sequence specs and spec sequences assuming that differences between them are clear.

### CoffeeScript Sublime Text snippets ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg) ![references](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-references-orange.svg)

Now, when you've hopefully get acquainted with [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) CoffeeScript code, take a look at [Sublime Text CoffeeScript snippets for ddry](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-sublime-coffee-snippets). We'll be able to install them via `Package Control: Install Package` as soon as my PR gets merged, but at the moment you can manually place them to your User packages.

### Injected target module context â€” `that` ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

Within spec file you may access target code module this way:

```coffee
'use strict'

module.exports = (dd) ->
  codeModule = dd.that
```

or that:

```coffee
'use strict'

module.exports = (dd, that) ->
  codeModule = that
```

With the power of default matchers set and cross-harness `before` and `after` hooks this is unlikely necessary, but for your JS freestyling you may use the approach you prefer.

### Property matcher ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

In [Introducing `property` matcher and cross-harness hooks and context](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/commit/cf4b2862fefac132ea8aae23d3a9ed7ff504b5f8) we meet methods setting the module public properties. Quite self-explaining code

```coffee
  dd.drive
    matcher: 'property'
    it: 'sets the "few" property of this module'
    i: [ 100500 ]
    e:
      few: 100500
```

applies `i` to subject method then checks that all the properties of `e` object match the target code module public properties.

### Cross-harness `context` ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

At the same [point](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/commit/cf4b2862fefac132ea8aae23d3a9ed7ff504b5f8) we meet [this](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/commit/cf4b2862fefac132ea8aae23d3a9ed7ff504b5f8#diff-f608b012420cc1d0ac167c8579a74d7d) spec presenting both main cross-harness features â€” `context` and hooks.

Cross-harness `dd.context`, same as Mocha `context`, takes the context title string as first argument and runs the following specs function inside this context. That produces the following effects through harnesses:
- in [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) behaves exactly as native nestable `context`
- in [Tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape) it's plainly a log message (all the nested contexts will be displayed at the same level)
- in [TAP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap) will produce no effect at all due to nature of TAP output.

Main purpose of this feature is to avoid stumbling when you need to use the context in your spec code structure on the test harness that does not support context.

### Cross-harness `before` and `after` hooks ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

At file and commit mentioned above we also can see the cross-harness `before` and `after` hooks. Yet while quite self-explaining, they have some specific features. First of all, both of them are spec object properties which enables them to be shared through specs sequence. So, inside full spec object (with `it` and `i`, `e` or `data`) it will act the same as corresponding Mocha hook, and when used as shared spec object it will act like `before_all` or `after_all` hook.

Another important feature is that inside these special spec object properties usual JS `this` keyword always points to the target code module (or its relevant instance). Just take a look at these expressive `@`s in the wild.

And again, if you need to organize your JS code flow with `before` and `after` hooks, or even their mass-effect versions, you should not stumble on that some test harness does not support these features. Hooks in general controversies are also not a thing to stumble on.

### Spec helper ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

First of all, no one can forbid you to `require` anything you need in your spec file â€” it's a conventional JS module after all, so please freestyle at your comfort as you wish. But to make your spec suite solid and its dependencies accountable you may find spec `helper` quite handy. Define it somewhere outside your set `spec` folder, not like in initially presenting the helper [Introducing spec helper and native Mocha hooks](https://github.com/ddry/ddry-guide/commit/2bde84352db17222ddfe6ab08f7caf0f41f79d1e). It was moved later, please note.

Spec helper is necessarily instantiated, so please make it a constructor. Also that means that you have to provide an initial value for instantiation, at least empty, wrapped into array. Specify the helper path and initial value in `ddry.json`:

```json
  "helper": {
    "path": "spec/helper",
    "initial": []
  },
```

and access its features across all of your specs with `dd.helper`.

_In this guide spec helper implements `forMocha` method to demonstrate native Mocha code inclusion. Looking at this code fragment one can possibly see awkward visibility scopes, `that` meaning `this`, code clarity DRYed out and other reasons to **never** use hooks. However, hooks in general controversy is outside the scope of this guide._

### Deep parameterizer method â€” `dd.ry` ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg) ![references](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-references-orange.svg)

Honestly, this whole [ddry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddry) thing is highly opinionated, and sometimes its pretending to be outside some general controversies is unbearable. Especially in this highly branded feature description. So, let's look into this list of statements:
- specs should not be DRY
- specs should not be repetitive
- specs should not contain indirectly defined examples
- specs should not be overloaded with details

When starting any **real** spec of method processing **real** data we find our position in the field polarized by these criteria very uncomfortable. We'll definitely fail at least half of them.

Deep parameterizer method `dd.ry` is not intended to reach any polar position â€” its purpose is enabling agility on this field. Really achievable balance is at some definite point on this field, so let's move there.

_However, among all the controversial subjects of this guide (and Node JS testing in general eventually) deep parameterizing is the best choice to shoot oneself in the foot (as many other things in software development world in general, eventually). Great power implies great responsibility â€” that looks quite familiar._

`dd.ry` takes three arguments:
- context
- value to apply to spec function
- spec function

It will spawn the cross-harness context if context title string given, pass something falsy if you don't want context.
And then you can create whatever spec object (or even spec sequence) from whatever parameters _(most advanced shoot-yourself-in-the-foot feature)_.

This deep parameterizer method has another usage context: when context is the only argument and given as object. Then it plainly shortcuts `dd.context` and `dd.drive` calls and keep you focused on your data. Please take a look at **ddry** matchers specs written in this manner: [anyOrder](https://github.com/ddry/ddry/blob/master/source/spec/lib/matchers/index/anyOrder.coffee) and [contains](https://github.com/ddry/ddry/blob/master/source/spec/lib/matchers/index/contains.coffee).

It's up to you to evaluate the compliance of these techniques to your preferred code style. Keep your feet safe.
